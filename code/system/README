This component is responsible for startup, shutdown and deployment of new
portions of the system. It will start tomcat, fetch new components from maven
central. There will be two running modes, master and slave. Slaves will 
listen for commands from a master. Those commands must be encrypted by a 
private key and the slave will require a copy of the matching public key.
