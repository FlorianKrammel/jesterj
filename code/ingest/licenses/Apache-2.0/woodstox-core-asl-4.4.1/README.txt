This repository is a flat dump of an unknown, but presumably late 4.4
code. No version history or tagging was retained, when it was migraged from
subversion to github so there is no solid information on exactly what
version the above notice applies to but this is the best we can do.
If anyone knows a better resource for determining the exact details
for this version please let us know!
