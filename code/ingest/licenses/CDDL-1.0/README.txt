This directory collects the required notification and documentation
required by the

CDDL-1.0

software license. Sub directories must be named after the actual artifact
included in our node-jar distribution, and per this license each sub directory
should contain:

1. Copy of License
2. Availability of Source Code

JeserJ does not distribute modified versions of software with CDDL-1.0
licensing, so other requirements mentioned in the CDDL do not need to be
listed here.
