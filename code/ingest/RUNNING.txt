I hate the fact that we need more than java -jar, but for now, the following may be useful

To run the jar output by this build, you need to specify a java policy file as per
http://river.apache.org/user-guide-basic-river-services.html. If you do not we will
install a policy that grants all permissions. This ensures your code never fails (and
neither does bad code).

java -Done-jar.silent=true -jar build/libs/ingest-node.jar

If you don't like doing all that typing for the one-jar property, I suggest you complain to
one-jar's author here:
