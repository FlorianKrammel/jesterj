I hate the fact that we need more than java -jar, but for now, the following may be useful

To run the jar output by this build, you need to specify a java policy file as per
http://river.apache.org/user-guide-basic-river-services.html. I use the following alias
to do this on MacOSX

alias j7a='/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java \
 -D/Users/gus/tools/jpolicy/all.policy -Djava.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi=net.jini.loader.pref.PreferredClassProvider'

You also probably want to turn off onejar's logging, so using that alias and turning off logging
looks like this:

j7a -Done-jar.silent=true -jar build/libs/ingest-node.jar

If you don't like doing all that typing for the one-jar property, I suggest you complain to
one-jar's author here:
