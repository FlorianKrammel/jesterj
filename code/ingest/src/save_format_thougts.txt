Need to represent a graph
Want to easily parse DSL to graphical display of graph.
Problem: dsl linear. How to connect nodes of graph...

Graph is directional and acyclic, so require previous definition?

Perhaps separate config for node from config for graph... 

Configurations will be stored in a directory structure similar to

<default config dir>
  +group_name
  |\
  | +config.jjg
  | +plan_name
  | |\
  | | +config.jj
  | | +step_name
  | | |\
  | | | +config.jjs
  | | | +processor_name.jjp
  | | | +router_name.jjr
  | | +step_name
  | | |\
  | | | +config.jjs
  | | | +processor_name.jjp
  | | | +router_name.jjr
  | | +step_name
  | |  \
  | |   +config.jjs
  | |   +processor_name.jjp
  | |   +router_name.jjr
  | +plan_name
  |  \
  |   +config.jj
  |   +step_name
  |   |\
  |   | +config.jjs
  |   | +processor_name.jjp
  |   | +router_name.jjr
  |   +step_name
  |   |\
  |   | +config.jjs
  |   | +processor_name.jjp
  |   | +router_name.jjr
  |   +step_name
  |    \
  |     +config.jjs
  |     +processor_name.jjp
  |     +router_name.jjr
  +group_name2
(etc)

Builder objects will be serialized as YAML, if this can be done in a deterministic manner. It's important that the
order of attributes be consistent every time the file is written. If not we may have to
