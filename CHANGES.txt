                      JesterJ Release Notes

Introduction
------------
JesterJ is an open source document ingestion framework, with a primary focus on making the process of getting
documents into a search engine as smooth as possible, both for small, quick use cases such as prototypes and 
large high volume production use cases.

See http://www.jesterj.org for more information, and https://github.com/nsoft/jesterj for roadmap/status


Getting Started
---------------
Java 1.8 VM or later is supported. Older VM's should be used at your own risk.

In this release, there is an example Plan that can be run by passing -Djj.example=run on the command line
This requires solr cloud with Zookeeper at 9983 on localhost and a collection named jjtest that is configured 
similarly to the dynamic schema example that comes with Solr.
