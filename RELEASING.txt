Things To Do when Cutting a Release

1. Make sure CHANGES.txt seems up to date. Ideally we should update this as we go, but read the top, make sure it's
   current and accurate.
   
2. Update the top level README. Make sure that the feature list is up to date, and the roeadmap to future versions
   seems sane, and doesn't contain completed items. 
   
3. Commit the final updates to the above file locally. 

4. Tag the commit with a tag named releases/<version> where version is something like 0.1 or 0.3.2 or 1.0 etc. Please
   be sure to ANNOTATE THE TAG with a message like "<version> release" so that it will be pushed to github.
   
5. Ensure that no issues with milestone less than or equal to the release version are open. Either close or
   move to a future release as appropriate. Ensure every un assigned issue that has a label also has a release
   unlabled issues are not accepted for development and thus do not need a release. 

6. Push the tagged commit and the tag to the main repo using the command: git push --follow-tags
