# Contributing 
To contribute to this project, please observe the following guidelines.

## To Make a Feature Suggestion:

1. Make an account on github (or log in to an existing one)
2. Describe your feature suggestion in detail in an issue
3. Wait for a response. You should get a response within a week, but as with almost every 
   open source project, paid employment comes first for the maintainer(s). If nobody has 
   responded in a week, feel free to join our slack channel and ask "has anyone had time
   to look at issue #<your issue number here>?" 
   
See the front page README for details on joining the slack channel.
   
Please do not send email with requests, or expect a response to verbal/slack/chat 
based requests. If it doesn't have a ticket it probably won't get done.
