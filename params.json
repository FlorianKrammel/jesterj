{"name":"JesterJ","tagline":"Document Ingestion Framework for Search Systems","body":"Document ingestion for search and analytics should be made easier. JesterJ is an attempt to satisfy [the document ingestion wishlist](#wishlist), with initial focus on support for ingesting documents from a local disk into a running instance of Apache Solr, but with the intention on supporting connectors for a wide variety of sources, and destinations.\r\n\r\n### Project Status\r\nEarly Alpha... Not much working yet. \r\n\r\n### Code\r\nThe github project is here [here](https://github.com/nsoft/jesterj)\r\n\r\n### The Document Ingestion Wish List <a name=\"wishlist\"></a>\r\n(please pardon github's terrible list format that uses the same style for every level)\r\n\r\n1.

DETECTED - Document needing to be processed\r\n    1. PROCESSING - Document has started traveling through the system\r\n    1. SENT - Document Left the ingestion system, and is being handled by the destination.\r\n    1. LIVE - Document is now available to users in the destination system (Callback)\r\n1.
